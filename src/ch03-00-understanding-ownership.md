# Understanding Cairo's linear type system

Cairo is a language built around a linear type system that allows us to
statically ensure that in every Cairo program, a value is used exactly once.
This is achieved by implementing an ownership system
and forbidding copying and dropping values by default. In this chapter, weâ€™ll
talk about Cairo's ownership system as well as references and snapshots.
